# Appoinment Service

# The very first input, patient id can be any integer value which has to be registered by the user API.
  Since here this Appoinment Service acts individually, any integer value could be entered as patient ID

# Doctor ID is also same as the patient ID but it is validated only to accept values 1 and 2 since email addresses
  must be visible in notification and only two doctors are added to the database
  with IDs 1 and 2.

# There are only two Hospitals added to the database so the input value is restrivted to be either 1 or 2.

# There areonly 5 treatment types available on the database so the input values are restricted to be a value
  within the range of 1 to 5.

# The time is considered as slots which is consisted with a value from 1 - 8 which meaans 1 represents
  8.00am - 9.00am and 8 represents 3.00pm - 4.00pm. So the values to that field are restricted to be a 
  value in range of 1 to 8.

# Once the appoinment is created, It'll be on the state of 'Pending' and once the appoinment is confirmed,
  It would change it's status. That's the update funcytion here

# Delete function here is just the usual delete.
